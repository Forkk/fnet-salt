    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is the default VHost for forkk.net's web server. You're seeing this
    page because the server didn't understand which VHost to route your request
    to. You see, the server has a lot of different sites to host, but sometimes,
    people ask him for a page on a site it doesn't know about. That's why you've
    been served this page.</p>
    <p>Perhaps you were looking for one of these sites?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://forkk.net/">Forkk.net</a> –
        A blog written by the crazy guy who manages this server.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="http://multimc.org/">MultiMC.org</a> –
        The website for MultiMC, a Minecraft launcher and mod manager.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="http://ci.multimc.org/">ci.multimc.org</a> –
        MultiMC's continuous integration server.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you really feel you were sent here by mistake, please let Forkk know
    there's something wrong with the server.</p>
